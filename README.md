# My Sway + Waybar Configuration

This repository contains my personal configuration for the system & workflow.  
Using Sway as window manager, Waybar as status bar, Wofi as application launcher.  
It is designed to be minimal, clean, easy to use, and efficient.

The setup is tested on **Fedora KDE**, running Sway as the Wayland tiling window manager.  
Additional applications and refinements may be added over time as I continue improving the workflow.

## Features
- Lightweight and minimal Sway configuration  
- Custom Waybar layout and styling  
- Sensible default keybindings  
- Focus on productivity, clarity, and low system overhead  

## Future Plans
- Add additional application configurations  
- Provide screenshots and a full setup guide  
- Expand Waybar modules and styling options
