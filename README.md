# My Sway + Waybar Configuration

This repository contains my personal configuration for the system & workflow.  
Using Sway as the window manager, Waybar as the status bar, Wofi as the application launcher.  
It is designed to be minimal, clean, easy to use, and efficient.

The setup is tested on **Fedora KDE**, running Sway as the Wayland tiling window manager.  
Additional applications and refinements may be added over time as I continue improving the workflow.

## Features
- Lightweight and minimal Sway configuration  
- Custom Waybar layout and styling  
- Sensible default keybindings  
- Focus on productivity, clarity, and low system overhead  

## Future Plans
- Add additional application configurations  
- Provide screenshots and a full setup guide  
- Expand Waybar modules and styling options
